# Module 10 Weekly Challenge - SVG Logo Maker 

## Description

 This application allows a user to generate a simple SVG logo in the CLI with three different shapes and allows the user to pick a colour using hexcode.

## Installation

Download the repository files to your computer and extract the zipped files to a dedicated folder or on the desktop.

## Requirements

- Node: https://nodejs.org/en

## Usage

Navigate to the repository in a git bash shell (or equivalent), and type "node index.js". You will be presented with a series of questions to customize your logo.
Once the user has answered all the questions, the application will attempt to generate an associated .svg file 'logo.svg'. If successful, the message "Generated logo.svg" will appear in the CLI. 
In case of an error, the CLI will respond with "Error occurred while trying to create logo.svg"
